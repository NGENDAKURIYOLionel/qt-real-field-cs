ImageRecognitionHelper needs libcurl to build. On Windows with Qt
Creator (MingW), you need to download the prebuilt library and headers
*. Extract the ZIP to a temporary location. Copy the headers from
include/curl/ (*.h) to the curl directory under the server project
directory. Also copy libcurldll.a from the lib directory to the curl
directory. Now the project should build on Windows. In order to run the
executable, you also need the DLLs from the bin directory. Place them in
the same directory where the executable gets built (or at least
somewhere where Windows will find them when running the executable).
