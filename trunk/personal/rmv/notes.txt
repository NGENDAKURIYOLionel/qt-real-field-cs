face detection
	adds tags to photograph
		each tag represents a face
		confidence should be over 50
		tags have TID
	attributes per face (irrelevant?):
		gender
		glasses
		smiling
		can be turned off
	center coordinates
		50 50 = center
		use for targeting?
	eye coordinates
	mouth coordinates
	face orientation
	recognizability
	can be given multiple photos (irrelevant?)

face recognition
	similar to detection
	give UIDs in addition to photos
	checks if UIDs present in photos
	can be given multiple photos (irrelevant?)

face grouping
	input is multiple photos so irrelevant

face status
	input is UIDs

tags save
	associates UIDs with tags
	you can make up the UID
	the tags you get from face detection

tags remove
	derp




faces detect
	get TIDs for detected faces
tags save
	attach UID to TID
faces train
	allows UID to be recognized


create temporary UIDs
	user input name
	+timestamping?
	namespace needs to be periodically purged from old users manually
		no api for namespace management


registration
	take pic
	call faces detect
	make sure
		only one face was detected in the pic
		face is recognizable
	if not, prompt user
		or use the face in the center
		or use the face with the highest confidence
